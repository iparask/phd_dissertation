\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe use cases and explain why they are computational campaigns.
    \item Show that campaigns can be simulation based, analysis based, and simulation analysis based
    \item RADICAL-EnTK and RP can be used to run simulation based campaigns
    \item They lack data-analytics based capabilities
    \item Question 1: How can these tools offer data analytics capabilities?
    \item Question 2: How does that affect the performance and how does EnTK and RP perform?
    \item Question 3: Is there a design choice that can affect the execution?
    \item Question 4: What is needed to fully support campaigns?
\end{itemize}
