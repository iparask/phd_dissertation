\maketitle

Scientific progress requires executing an increasing number of computational workflows to achieve scientific discovery. We are motivated by the needs of ecological and biomolecular use cases in which workflows are ensembles of up to $O(10^5)$ computational tasks, organized in up to $O(10^3)$ pipelines~\cite{rietmann2012forward, dakka2018high, paraskevakos2019workflow} with heterogeneous resource requirements. When $O(10)$ workflows, with or without dependencies amongst them, are required to be executed to achieve scientific discovery where, based on our target use cases, each workflow can process and/or produce up to 100TB of data, and execute tasks running for up to 24 hours each, they constitute a computational campaign. More formally, a computational campaign is a set of $O(10)$ heterogeneous workflows, with or without dependencies amongst them, that need to be executed to achieve a scientific objective. Effective and efficient execution of computational campaigns requires resource management and coordination at runtime.


Workflows are mainly executed by utilizing dedicated workflow management frameworks~\cite{balasubramanian2018harnessing,deelman2015pegasus,ludascher2006scientific,rocklin2015dask,airflow}. Currently, workflow management frameworks offer a vast array of capabilities but, to the best of our knowledge, lack campaign planning and execution capabilities. Campaign planning and execution requires scheduling workflows to resources, resolving dependencies between workflows, as well as managing the execution of every workflow in the campaign. As a result, users, when executing a computational campaign, have to decide and execute a campaign execution plan, often requiring to solve a non trivial scheduling problem, manually resolve dependencies, and manage their workflows’ execution. Thus, a campaign manager to automatically derive an execution plan, execute and adapt it, is desirable.


Resources, workflows and campaigns can either be static or dynamic. A resource is considered static when a task requires a constant amount of time to execute, or dynamic when the execution time of the task is drawn from a distribution.  A workflow can be known \textit{a-priori}, i.e. all tasks and dependencies described, and thus static~\cite{paraskevakos2019workflow}, or change during runtime by adding tasks and dependencies, thus dynamic~\cite{dakka2018high}. Accordingly, when the set of workflows, and their dependencies, that comprise the campaign is known \textit{a-priori}, the campaign is considered static, and when the set of workflows, by adding workflows, change it is considered dynamic.


Executing computational campaigns allows users to realize a computational objective under given requirements and constraints, via enacting an execution plan. A computational objective is user selected bounds of a set of metrics, such as time to completion and throughput. This objective can then be represented as an objective function. Requirements describe the minimum amount and type of resources needed to execute each workflow of the campaign, while constraints are the conditions that bound the execution of the campaign, including but not limited  to, resource availability, capacity, and costs. A plan describes a sequence of actions such as selecting, acquiring and configuring resources, that solve the objective function.


Planning the execution and executing a computational campaign poses three main challenges: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item evaluate the time needed to execute all the workflows, i.e. makespan, of a campaign on heterogeneous and dynamic resources,
\item determining a plan between workflows of a campaign and available resources that satisfies an objective function while being subject to the requirements and constraints of a campaign, and
\item adapting the plan in case of deviating from the objective achievement.
\end{inparaenum}

In accordance with those challenges and within the requirements of our target use cases, this work will offer three main contributions: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item an algorithm to calculate the makespan of a campaign on heterogeneous resources;
\item a software system that implements the makespan algorithm and executes a campaign on resources; and 
\item a method to evaluate the performance of our approach compared to a random plan. 
\end{inparaenum}
Compared to existing solutions, our research will allow users to execute campaigns that contain $O(10)$ workflows with $O(1000)$ tasks. We will implement these contributions into a software prototype designed to execute ecological and biomolecular use cases on high performance computing (HPC) resources, using an existing workflow execution framework as implemented by RADICAL-EnsembleToolkit (EnTK)~\cite{balasubramanian2018harnessing}.


The makespan of a campaign is the time needed to execute all the workflows of the campaign, or alternatively, the maximum execution time among all paths throughout the campaign~\cite{chirkin2017execution}. Several methods have been proposed~\cite{lu2019review} to calculate the makespan of a workflow, including queuing network~\cite{yao2019throughput,bao2019performance}, domain specific languages~\cite{carothers2017durango,maheshwari2016workflow}, and mathematical programming~\cite{liu2017mathematical}. Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT)~\cite{topcuoglu2002performance} is an offline scheduling algorithm which calculates the makespan of a workflow on heterogeneous resources. HEFT uses a matrix to represent execution time of tasks on resources. HEFT assigns tasks to the resource that minimizes the finish time of the task. HEFT has complexity proportional to the number of dependencies between tasks and the number of processors offered. Furthermore, there has been some initial research to extend HEFT to resources that provide CPU and GPUs~\cite{shetti2013optimization}. We propose to extend HEFT algorithm to calculate the makespan of a computational campaign.


Calculating the makespan of a computational campaign depends on workflow characteristics, workflow dependencies, campaign dynamicity, and resource availability and dynamicity. Task execution time depends on parallelism, coordination between tasks, task characteristics~\cite{khoshlessan2017parallel}, the framework used to support task execution~\cite{paraskevakos2018task}, and resource dynamicity~\cite{paraskevakos2019workflow}. We propose to utilize approximations of task execution time that we will experimentally derive.


Based on workflow tasks’ characteristics, resources may need to be configured with different execution engines. Compute intensive tasks on HPC resources are mainly executed via OpenMP/MPI benefitting from parallelism at scale, while data intensive tasks via data parallel frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark~\cite{zaharia2010spark}, or Dask~\cite{rocklin2015dask}. Traditionally, HPC resources are designed to optimize the execution of MPI tasks, leaving data-parallel frameworks largely unsupported. In Ref.~\cite{luckow2016hadoop}, we show how a pilot-based middleware~\cite{merzky2019using} can support the efficient and scalable execution of data-parallel applications on HPC resources. Such capabilities are necessary to support and plan the execution of a data-intensive campaign.

We propose to define a campaign manager (CM) which, given a campaign, an objective, and a set of constraints, can derive an execution plan by utilizing the proposed makespan methods. Figure 1 shows a reference architecture of the proposed framework. Fig.~\ref{refarch} shows a reference architecture of the framework. We propose to define a campaign manager (CM). CM has two sub-components: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Makespan Calculation which implements the proposed makespan algorithm, and 
\item an Executor which executes the plan. Workflow execution is done through RADICAL-EnTK to HPC resources
\end{inparaenum}.
Based on workflows metrics, such as tasks execution time, overheads calculation and time to completion, provided by EnTK,  and as a consequence the respective workflows and campaign metrics, CEM will adapt the execution plan if necessary by updating the workflows to resource mapping decisions.


To understand the performance of the proposed approach, we will compare it with a randomly decided execution plan. We propose to model a random decision as the mapping of a campaign’s workflows to resources based on a uniform distribution between resources. The random plan provides a baseline of performance. Based on this comparison, we will be able to validate whether our approach offered better performance, i.e. smaller makespan after execution, as well as to better understand the problem’s requirements for further research and development.


Given the size of the problem space and that the proposed work will be performed in no more than one year, we propose to focus on the three main contributions described above. In more detail, we will focus on: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item evaluating and deriving the makespan for a campaign as a set of independent static O(10) workflows with heterogeneous resource requirements provided by ecological and biomolecular sciences use cases on static resources; 
\item offering execution planning capabilities to minimize the makespan of a campaign; and 
\item validating our planning capability by executing the workflows of our use cases and measuring the accuracy of the estimated campaign runtime and planned execution
\end{inparaenum}. In addition, we will explore the requirements to support execution plan adaptivity.


To this end, we propose to achieve the following objectives with an estimation of the time needed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Derive the makespan for a campaign from the ecological sciences. Durations 3 months.
    \item Develop a campaign manager, which will derive and execute a plan based on the results of objective 1. Duration 4 months, overlap with the last month of objective 1.
    \item Integration with scientific workflows and experimentally validate the plan by measuring the average deviation of the manager from the optimal objective. Duration 4 months. The first two months overlap with objective 2.
\end{enumerate}
