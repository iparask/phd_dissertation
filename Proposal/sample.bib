abstract="Complex pervasive systems are typically composed of a large number of heterogeneous nodes, pervasively distributed across the environment. These systems pose several new challenges such as the need for nodes to autonomously and dynamically manage themselves in order to achieve some common goal, despite to the continuous evolution of the surrounding environment. An important research area for these systems regards the identification of proper load balancing mechanisms that, depending on the current utilization of resources at a node and on its knowledge of the neighbourhood, aim at optimizing at runtime the global system state with simple local actions without a centralized intelligence.",

    Title = {The impact of heterogeneous computing on workflows for biomolecular simulation and analysis},
    Volume = {17},
    Year = {2015},
    Abstract = {The field of biomolecular simulation has matured to the level that detailed, accurate, and functionally relevant information that complements experimental data about the structure, dynamics, and interactions of biomolecules can now be routinely discovered. This has been enabled by access to large scale and heterogeneous high performance computing resources, including special purpose hardware. The improved performance of modern simulation methods coupled with hardware advances is shifting the rate-limiting steps of common biomolecular simulations of small- to moderately-sized systems from the generation of data (for example via production molecular dynamics simulations that used to take weeks or even months) to the pre- and post-processing phases of the workflow, namely simulation set-up and data processing, management, and analysis. Access to heterogeneous computational resources enables a broader exploration of biomolecular structure and dynamics by facilitating distinct aspects of typical biomolecular simulation workflows.},
