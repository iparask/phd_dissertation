\abstract{Many scientific application workflows are becoming larger and need to 
be executed multiple times with different parameters, generating a scientific 
computational campaign. Domains such as molecular dynamics, biological, and 
environmental sciences, define workflows and pipelines that are executed $O(1k)$ 
to $O(10k)$ times. In addition, based on results obtained during runtime the 
application computational requirements may change. Managing computational 
resources to reduce time to completion, maximize utilization, and maximize 
scientific insight, is becoming necessary. In this proposal, we present research 
done to understand:
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item scientific application time to completion characterization,
        \item scalability behavior of scientific workflows based on programming models.
       \end{inparaenum}
We summarize preliminary results from our research for modeling scientific workflows 
in terms of time to completion, and propose an autonomic workload manager to manage 
workflow execution on High Performance resources. We include a work plan to investigate, 
formulate and implement the proposed workload manager and evaluate foreseen challenges 
and risks}

\section{Proposed Research}

In our research so far, we discussed a conceptual model for data analytics for 
various use cases on HPC system, and a design comparison and execution time model 
for scientific workflows. In addition, we identified a need for execution of 
scientific workflows with minimum user intervention, independent from users' 
scientific domain. In this section, we motivate and propose an autonomic middleware 
for configuring, monitor and adapting the execution of scientific workflows on 
HPCs.
