\abstract{Scientific applications, with constant streams of data or simulations, are benefiting from executing computational campaigns, instead of executing a single workflow.
Computational campaigns enact an execution plan to achieve an objective under given requirements and constraints.
HPC resources, used by domain scientists, are dynamic as their availability changes in time.
In this proposal, we present current research to address the challenges of: (1) supporting the efficient and scalable data-parallel application on HPC resources; (2) understanding resource dynamicity; and (3) supporting computational campaigns on HPC resources.
We summarize research results from our publications, and propose a campaign manager, which given a campaign, an objective, and a set of constraints, can derive an execution plan by utilizing a makespan calculation method.
We include a work plan to investigate, formulate and implement the proposed campaign and evaluate foreseen challenges and risks.}
